        <p>Ballet (French: [bal…õ]) is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres and cultures. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures and as a result, the art has evolved in a number of distinct ways. See glossary of ballet.</p>
        <p>A ballet, a work, consists of the choreography and music for a ballet production. Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers. Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets, such as the neoclassical works of American choreographer George Balanchine, often are performed in simple costumes (e.g., leotards and tights) and without the use of elaborate sets or scenery.</p>
        <h2>Styles</h2>
        <p>Stylistic variations and subgenres have evolved over time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Classical ballet</li>
            <li>Romantic ballet</li>
            <li>Neoclassical ballet</li>
            <li>Contemporary ballet</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technical methods of ballet instruction</h2>
        <p>There are six widely used, internationally recognized methods to teach or study ballet:</p>

        <ol>
        <li>French method</li>
        <li>Vaganova method</li>
        <li>Cecchetti method</li>
        <li>Bournonville method</li>
        <li>The Royal Academy of Dance method (RAD)</li>
        <li>Balanchine method</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Ballet as a career</h2>
        <p>Professional dancers are generally not well paid. As of 2017, American dancers (including ballet and other dance forms) were paid an average of US$14.25 per hour.
         The job outlook is not strong, and the competition to get a job is intense, with the number of applicants vastly exceeding the number of job openings.Some dancers earn money by participating in dancing competitions and are awarded with money or high paying contracts.Choreographers were paid nearly twice the amount of dancers in 2017.</p>
